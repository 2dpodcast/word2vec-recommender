# word2vec-recommender

Talk Submission at Pycon India 2016: https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/creating-a-recommendation-engine-based-on-contextual-word-embeddings~aOZGe/

How can we create a recommendation engine that is based both on user browsing history and product reviews? Can I create recommendations purely based on the 'intent' and 'context' of the search?

This talk will showcase how a recommendation engine can be built with user browser history and user-generated reviews using a state of the art technique - word2vec. We will create something that not only matches the existing recommender systems deployed by websites, but goes one step ahead - incorporating context to generate valid and innovative recommendations. The beauty of such a framework is that not only does it support online learning, but is also sensitive to minor changes in user tone and behavior.

The trick/secret sauce is - How do we account for the 'context' and build it in our systems? The talk will answer these questions and showcase effectiveness of such a recommender system.

Note:
A subset of the engine's functionality was completed during a project undertaken at IASNLP 2016 held by Language Technology Research Center (LTRC), IIIT Hyderabad
